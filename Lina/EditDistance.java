/*Given two words word1 and word2, find the minimum number of steps required to convert word1 to word2. (each operation is counted as 1 step.)

You have the following 3 operations permitted on a word:

a) Insert a character
b) Delete a character
c) Replace a character*/

public class Solution {
    public int minDistance(String word1, String word2) {
        int n = word1.length();
        int m = word2.length();
        
        int[][] dp = new int[n+1][m+1];
        for(int i=0; i< m+1; i++){
            dp[0][i] = i; 
        }
        for(int i=0; i<n+1; i++){
            dp[i][0] = i;
        }
        
        
        for(int i = 1; i<n+1; i++){
            for(int j=1; j<m+1; j++){
                if(word1.charAt(i-1) == word2.charAt(j-1)){
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1];
                }else{
                    dp[i][j] = 1 + Math.min(dp[i-1][j-1],Math.min(dp[i-1][j],dp[i][j-1]));
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[n][m];
    }
}

Use f[i][j] to represent the shortest edit distance between word1[0,i) and word2[0, j). Then compare the last character of word1[0,i) and word2[0,j), which are c and d respectively (c == word1[i-1], d == word2[j-1]):

if c == d, then : f[i][j] = f[i-1][j-1]

Otherwise we can use three operations to convert word1 to word2:

(a) if we replaced c with d: f[i][j] = f[i-1][j-1] + 1;

(b) if we added d after c: f[i][j] = f[i][j-1] + 1;

(c) if we deleted c: f[i][j] = f[i-1][j] + 1;

Note that f[i][j] only depends on f[i-1][j-1], f[i-1][j] and f[i][j-1], therefore we can reduce the space to O(n) by using only the (i-1)th array and previous updated element(f[i][j-1]).
